# Project Config

## Git
provider: github
base_branch: main

## Stack
Unified pnpm-managed Next.js/TypeScript application at the repo root (`src/`) — App Router, seven bounded-context folders under `src/bcs/` plus `src/shared/{db,ui,config,logging}`, per `context/repo-structure.md`. Currently an empty scaffold (no business logic yet). The previous split Python/FastAPI backend and Next.js 14 frontend are preserved at `legacy/backend/` and `legacy/frontend/` (SQLAlchemy async + asyncpg, Alembic, MCP server, uv/ruff/pytest; Radix UI + Tailwind), run manually during the transition — as of `005-docker-compose-dev-environment`, `docker compose up -d` now builds and runs the new unified scaffold (`app` service) instead. Postgres database (`database/`); schema creation is owned by Drizzle migrations (`pnpm db:migrate`), not a pre-baked init script. Docker Compose for local dev; Helm chart (`charts/skillcanon/`) for Kubernetes deploy, published to GHCR as an OCI artifact.

Note: this is the TypeScript refactor in progress (epic `001-typescript-refactor-foundation`). Re-run as-setup-project once the legacy backend/frontend are fully retired to drop the legacy-specific notes below.

## Compliance
hipaa: false
soc2: true
gdpr: false
pci: false

Note: NIST (likely NIST 800-53 / CSF alignment) also called out as in-scope alongside SOC2. Not a dedicated as-finish check yet — flag NIST-relevant controls (access control, audit logging, encryption) manually until a dedicated check exists.

## Install
pnpm install

## Dev
pnpm dev

## Build
pnpm build

## Rebuild (self-hosted stack — runs the new unified `app` + `database` services)
docker compose up -d

## Type check
pnpm typecheck

Note: the new scaffold has strict TypeScript project-wide. Legacy backend has no type checker configured (no mypy/pyright) — it's the code this rewrite is replacing, not something to extend coverage to.

## Lint
pnpm lint

Note: legacy lint commands (`cd legacy/backend && ruff check .` / `cd legacy/frontend && npm run lint`) still work against the preserved legacy code if needed.

## Test
unit: pnpm vitest run src/proxy.test.ts 'src/app/(app)/app-shell-access.test.ts' 'src/app/(app)/_components/nav-model.test.ts' 'src/app/(app)/_components/app-navigation.test.tsx' 'src/app/(app)/_components/account-footer.test.tsx' 'src/app/(app)/_components/app-shell.test.tsx' src/bcs/billing-entitlements/application/resolve-entitlements.test.ts src/bcs/billing-entitlements/application/has-entitlement.test.ts src/bcs/identity-access/application/authenticate-session.test.ts
integration: pnpm test

Note: legacy backend tests still run via `cd legacy/backend && uv run pytest tests/ -v` (use `uv run`, not bare `python -m pytest` — deps live in uv's managed venv). If pytest/pytest-asyncio are missing (`ModuleNotFoundError`), the venv only has base deps — run `uv sync --extra dev` first (bare `uv sync` does not install the `dev` optional-dependency group). Legacy frontend has no test script configured. The new scaffold's `pnpm test` (Vitest) is no longer a trivial smoke test — as of `011-tenant-isolation-rls` it's 45 test files / 237 tests, ~166s, mostly Testcontainers-backed Postgres integration tests. Run it with a >120s timeout or in the background (`run_in_background`), not the default foreground timeout.

## Rebuild — port conflicts
This machine runs multiple unrelated Docker Compose projects concurrently (tribe-build, multica,
supabase stack, seamless-postgres). SkillCanon's default ports (5432 database, 3000 app — plus 8000 if
running the legacy backend manually alongside) can collide with them. Confirmed resolution
preference: stop the conflicting containers from the other project rather than remap SkillCanon's
ports — ask before stopping anything, since it affects other in-progress work.
