# Prompt Registry — Contract

**Owner:** Ben Anderson
**Status:** Draft

## Purpose

Owns `Project`, `Prompt`, `PromptVersion`, `PromptShare`, and the expansion engine — the other core-domain context. Expansion renders a prompt version's templates against caller input, weaves in Governance's effective policies/objectives, and resolves recursive prompt-inclusion references up to a max depth. This context calls Governance through its read contract only — it must never query `governance.*` tables directly, since that coupling is exactly what made the current Python `expand_prompt` hard to reason about.

## Exposed APIs

| Endpoint / Method | Description | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| `expand(orgId, promptName, input, { userId?, projectId?, version? })` | Returns `{ systemMessage, userMessage, appliedPolicies }` | Workflow Orchestration, Distribution (`sh-run`) |
| `listPrompts(orgId, userId, { page, pageSize })` | Prompts owned by or shared with the user | Distribution (`sh-list`, `sh-search`, UI) |
| `getPrompt(orgId, name)` | Latest version + metadata | Distribution, Workflow Orchestration (step validation) |
| `createPrompt`, `publishVersion`, `sharePrompt`, `createProject`, `addProjectMember` | Standard write operations, org-scoped | Distribution (route handlers) |

## Events Published

| Event | Payload summary | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| `PromptCreated` / `PromptVersionPublished` | orgId, promptId, versionId, actorUserId | Audit |
| `PromptShared` | orgId, promptId, sharedWithUserId | Audit |
| `PromptExpanded` | orgId, promptId, versionId, callerUserId, appliedPolicyIds | Distribution (writes `PromptUsage`), Audit |

## Events Consumed

| Event | From BC | What this BC does with it |
|---|---|---|
| none | — | Expansion always calls Governance synchronously at request time; it does not react to Governance events |

## Data Contracts

```ts
interface ExpansionResult {
  systemMessage: string | null;
  userMessage: string;
  appliedPolicies: string[]; // policy names, for transparency to the caller
}

interface PromptSummary {
  id: string; orgId: string; name: string; description: string | null;
  isDeprecated: boolean; ownerUserId: string | null;
  latestVersion: { version: string; tags: string[] } | null;
}
```

`name` is unique **within an organization**, not globally — corrected from the current single-tenant schema.

## Stability Guarantees

`expand()`'s output shape and the recursive-inclusion max depth (`MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH`) are stable; increasing the depth limit is backward compatible, decreasing it is not.

## Breaking Change Policy

Changes to template syntax (Nunjucks tag set) or inclusion resolution order are called out in the PR description and, if they change existing prompt output, require a PDR.
