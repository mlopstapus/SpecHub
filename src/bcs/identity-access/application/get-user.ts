/**
 * Reads one user by id, returning the `UserSummary` shape only (never
 * `username`, `display_name`, `is_active`, `password_hash`, or timestamps —
 * bcs/identity-access/CONTRACT.md). Completes an API `CONTRACT.md` already
 * promised before this feature existed to implement it.
 *
 * `organizationId` is optional (011-tenant-isolation-rls): when given, the
 * lookup is scoped via `findByOrgAndId` and a cross-org `userId` throws the
 * same as a nonexistent one (M1). When omitted, falls back to the unscoped
 * lookup below — reserved for callers with no organization to scope by yet
 * (`authenticateSession`'s pre-auth resolution, and `logout`, which only
 * ever receives a bare `userId`) — both must be called with the
 * `skillcanon_auth`-connected client. Any other caller should pass its own
 * already-established `organizationId`.
