# Workflow Views UI

The real, finished workflow list/creation/detail UI — owned by this BC per `bcs/workflow-orchestration/OWNERSHIP.md` (`src/app/(app)/workflows/*`) — composed into the shared shell from `004-app-shell-and-landing/002-app-shell-and-navigation.md`, with real design applied directly rather than deferred to a later redesign pass, mirroring `003-audit-compliance/003-audit-log-ui.md` and `005-governance/005-governance-views-ui.md`.

**Status (2026-07-23): no Claude design mockup exists yet for these pages.** Pull the corresponding mockup(s) via the `claude_design` MCP server first and run the same gap-analysis pass against `001-workflow-model-and-crud.md`/`002-workflow-runner.md`/`004-workflow-sharing.md` before finalizing this file's Requirements — don't invent them from a description.

## Requirements

- [ ] Pull the workflows mockup(s) from claude.ai/design before finalizing the rest of this list
- [ ] `workflows` (list), `workflows/new`, `workflows/[id]` (detail, including run history/status) — page inventory carried over from the now-dissolved `010-ui-polish-and-accessibility` epic's original redesign scope; confirm against the actual mockup once it exists

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create/view/run a workflow works end-to-end through this UI
- [ ] Step sequencing and run status are clearly legible
- [ ] The page(s) visually match whatever mockup is pulled in

## Open Questions

- Which mockup file(s) cover these pages — none were found alongside the three existing mockups (Audit, Governance, Landing) as of 2026-07-23.

## Dependencies

- `002-workflow-runner.md`
- `003-workflow-tenant-isolation-tests.md`
- `004-workflow-sharing.md`
- `backlog/004-app-shell-and-landing/EPIC.md`

## Technical Notes

Workflow execution/runner logic (`002-workflow-runner.md`) is out of scope here — pure presentation of run history/status.
