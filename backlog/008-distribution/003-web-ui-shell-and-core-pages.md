# Web UI Final Composition & Integration Check

**Scope reduced (2026-07-23)**: this feature originally owned building the entire app shell and every core page. Both responsibilities moved earlier in the backlog once real design mockups made that possible sooner than epic 008's original slot: the app shell/layout/auth-gated routing now belongs to `004-app-shell-and-landing/002-app-shell-and-navigation.md`, and each BC's own pages are now built by that BC's own epic (`003-audit-compliance/003-audit-log-ui.md`, `005-governance/005-governance-views-ui.md`, `006-prompt-registry/006-prompt-registry-views-ui.md`, `007-workflow-orchestration/005-workflow-views-ui.md`, `002-identity-access/009-auth-and-onboarding-ui.md` + `010-account-and-team-settings-ui.md`, `009-billing-entitlements/003-billing-portal-and-ui.md`) — mirroring `003-audit-log-ui.md`'s original pattern. This feature no longer builds a page or the shell; it's the point where every one of those already-built pieces gets composed together and re-verified as a working whole against the new REST API, since each was built independently in its own epic.

## Requirements

- [ ] Every owning BC's page (see list above) is actually wired into the real shell from `004-app-shell-and-landing/002-app-shell-and-navigation.md` — no BC left composing into a stale/placeholder shell
- [ ] Any standalone shell/middleware stand-in a BC epic had to build ahead of `004-app-shell-and-landing` (only `003-audit-compliance/003-audit-log-ui.md` did this, as an explicitly-flagged one-off) is confirmed absorbed and deleted, not left running in parallel
- [ ] Full page-by-page parity audit against the legacy `legacy/frontend/src/app/*` tree — confirm nothing was missed across the now-distributed set of owning epics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every core workflow available in the legacy frontend (create/view/edit a prompt, policy, objective, workflow, team, project) is available in the rebuilt UI, end to end, through the real composed shell
- [ ] Unauthenticated access to any `(app)` route redirects to login
- [ ] Manual smoke test: create a team → create a project → create a policy → create a prompt → expand it via the UI, confirms the applied policy appears in the result

## Open Questions

- None currently — the page-by-page parity list is this feature's own first requirement now, not an open question to resolve later.

## Dependencies

- `001-rest-api-core-routes.md`
- `backlog/004-app-shell-and-landing/EPIC.md`

## Technical Notes

This feature is now an integration/verification checkpoint, not a build — by the time it starts, every page it touches should already exist and be individually working within its own owning epic. If a real gap surfaces here (a page nobody actually built, a BC that skipped composing into the shell), track it back to that BC's own epic rather than building it inline in this feature.
