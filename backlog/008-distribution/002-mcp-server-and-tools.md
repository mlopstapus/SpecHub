# MCP Server & Tools

**Deprioritized as of the skill-sync design (`005-skill-sync-cli.md`)** — see Technical Notes. Left `status: open` because it's still valid future work if a non-skill-capable MCP client shows up wanting programmatic access, just no longer the next thing to build in this epic.

Port the MCP server and all six tools from the current Python `mcp/server.py`, `mcp/session.py`, `mcp/tools.py`, using the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` TS SDK running in-process in the Next.js app, per the architecture's assumption. This is a strict compatibility port — tool names and argument shapes are a public contract every connected IDE's config already depends on.

## Requirements

- [ ] MCP server mounted at `/mcp`, Streamable HTTP transport, bearer-authenticated via `authenticateApiKey` — **called with `shared/db/client.ts`'s `authDb`, never the ordinary `db`** — see `backlog/002-identity-access/008-authdb-consumer-handoff.md` and `bcs/identity-access/CONTRACT.md`'s per-function notes (011-tenant-isolation-rls)
- [ ] All six tools ported with identical names and argument shapes: `sh-list`, `sh-search`, `sh-context`, `sh-run`, `sh-workflow-list`, `sh-workflow-run`
- [ ] Session state (resolved `userId` cache, "context already delivered" flag) implemented in-memory per process, per PDR-008 — ephemeral, safe to lose on restart
- [ ] `sh-run` calls `withAudit()` for every expansion — closing the gap tenet C1 explicitly calls out (current Python `sh_run` never calls `record_usage`, unlike the REST `/expand` path)
- [ ] Session-context auto-injection (policies/objectives block on first call per session) matches current behavior exactly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each tool produces output equivalent to the current Python implementation for equivalent input (characterization-style comparison)
- [ ] `sh-run` produces an audit event for every call — verified by test, closing the tenet C1 gap
- [ ] No log statement in this feature includes any portion of a raw API key (tenet S3 — the specific gap called out in the tenets doc for `mcp/tools.py`)
- [ ] A process restart mid-session causes at most one extra API-key validation round trip, not a broken session (per PDR-008)

## Open Questions

- None — behavior fully specified by the existing Python implementation and the architecture's PDR-008 session-state decision.

## Dependencies

- All five prior bounded-context epics (002, 003, 004, 005, 006)

## Technical Notes

Per `bcs/distribution/CONTRACT.md`'s Breaking Change Policy, any deviation in tool name or argument shape from the current implementation is a breaking change to every user's existing MCP config — treat this feature as a strict compatibility port, not a redesign opportunity, even where the new architecture might suggest a cleaner tool shape. Directly closes the tenet C1 and S3 gaps the tenets document explicitly calls out by name.

**Deprioritization rationale:** `005-skill-sync-cli.md` makes governed prompts show up as native Claude Code skills via a plain REST call (`/prompts/expand/{name}`, already planned in `001-rest-api-core-routes.md`) instead of requiring the IDE to be configured as an MCP client. The reliability problem this was meant to solve — an agent deciding to call the right tool — turned out to be about invocation UX, not transport: a Skill is matched deterministically by name/description, an MCP tool call is not. For an IDE that doesn't support skills, standing up an MCP server doesn't obviously help either, since the same tool-selection reliability problem remains. This feature stays on the backlog for if/when a concrete non-skill-capable MCP client actually needs programmatic access (or for `sh-workflow-run`'s multi-step orchestration, which `005` does not attempt to replace), but `005-skill-sync-cli.md` is the priority now.
