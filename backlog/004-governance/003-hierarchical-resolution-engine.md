# Hierarchical Resolution Engine

Port `resolve_effective` and `resolve_all_policies` (and the equivalent objective resolution) from the current Python `policy_service.py`/`objective_service.py` — the two-layer inherited/local resolution walk that is SpecHub's actual differentiator. This is the single highest-risk piece of the entire refactor: correctness here is silent when wrong.

## Requirements

- [ ] `resolveEffectivePolicies(orgId, userId, projectId?)`: walks `getTeamChain`, splits into `inherited` (ancestor teams, immutable) and `local` (user's own team + optional project layer, mutable), matching current Python semantics exactly
- [ ] `resolveEffectiveObjectives(orgId, userId, projectId?)`: same shape for objectives
- [ ] `resolveAllPolicies(orgId, userId, projectId?)`: single merged list, priority descending, **inherited wins ties** — matching current Python tiebreak behavior exactly
- [ ] Read-fresh, never cached — no memoization that could serve a stale policy set within or across requests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Characterization test suite**: a representative set of team hierarchies + policy/objective fixtures run through both the current Python implementation and the new TS implementation, asserting identical output for every fixture, before this feature is considered done
- [ ] A policy at the same priority as an inherited policy resolves with the inherited one taking precedence, matching current behavior
- [ ] A user's own local policy correctly overrides/coexists with inherited ancestor policies per the existing two-layer model
- [ ] No test or code path introduces caching of resolution results

## Open Questions

- None — behavior is fully specified by the existing Python implementation; the job here is faithful port plus test-proven equivalence, not redesign.

## Dependencies

- `001-policy-model-and-crud.md`
- `002-objective-model-and-crud.md`
- `backlog/002-identity-access/002-team-hierarchy.md` (`getTeamChain`)

## Technical Notes

Per `context/architecture.md`'s explicit risk callout and `docs/pdr/001-typescript-unification.md`'s mitigation plan, this feature is where characterization testing matters most in the entire rewrite. Per `bcs/governance/CONTRACT.md`'s Stability Guarantees, resolution must remain read-your-writes consistent within a request — a stale policy silently applied is a correctness bug, not a performance tradeoff, so no caching layer belongs in this feature regardless of how tempting it is for the recursive team-chain walk's performance.
