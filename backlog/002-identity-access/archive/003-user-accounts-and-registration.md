# User Accounts & Registration

Port `User` from the current Python `models.py`/`user_service.py`, correcting the uniqueness constraints from global to org-scoped — the specific multi-tenancy bug PDR-003 exists to prevent (two different orgs both wanting a user named "admin").

## Requirements

- [X] `identity_access.users` table: `id`, `organization_id`, `team_id`, `username`, `display_name`, `email`, `password_hash` (nullable), `role`, `is_active`, timestamps
- [X] `(organization_id, email)` and `(organization_id, username)` unique constraints — **not globally unique**, correcting the current schema (comparison is case-insensitive, values normalized to lowercase before storage — see `specs/007-user-accounts-registration/spec.md`'s Clarifications)
- [X] CRUD: create user (admin-only), update user, deactivate user, list users by team/org
- [X] Password hashing via bcrypt, matching tenet S1 (secrets hashed at rest, never stored reversibly) — via `bcryptjs` (research.md §1, no native-binding Docker risk)
- [X] First-run registration route wires `identity_access`'s `bootstrapOrganization` (built in `001-organization-tenant-model.md`) to a real `provisionTeamAndAdmin` callback that creates actual `teams`/`users` rows, replacing that feature's test-only stub — delivered as `registerFirstRunAdmin`, an application-layer composition function; the actual HTTP route wiring is owned by `backlog/007-distribution/001-rest-api-core-routes.md` (depends on this epic completing first, not the reverse — see `specs/007-user-accounts-registration/research.md` §5)
- [X] Per constitution tenet G1 (Feature-Gated by Entitlement), the registration route MUST gate on a `resolveEntitlements()` check before doing real work, even though Billing & Entitlements (epic 008) doesn't exist yet — gate on a key that defaults to enabled for both tiers (per tenet G1's own wording) rather than skipping the gate call; if `resolveEntitlements()` genuinely can't be called yet, document that as an explicit, temporary constitution exception here (mirroring the tracked exception pattern in `specs/005-org-tenant-model/plan.md`'s Complexity Tracking), not a silently skipped gate — **done via a documented, temporary hardcoded-`true` stand-in** (`src/bcs/identity-access/application/entitlement-gate.ts`), tracked forward in `backlog/008-billing-entitlements/004-entitlement-enforcement-integration.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [X] Two different organizations can each have a user with email `admin@example.com` with no conflict — verified by test
- [X] Within one organization, a second user with the same email is rejected
- [X] `password_hash` is never returned in any API response shape, verified by a test asserting the response schema excludes it

## Open Questions

- None currently.

## Dependencies

- `001-organization-tenant-model.md`
- `002-team-hierarchy.md` (every user belongs to a team)

## Technical Notes

Per `bcs/identity-access/CONTRACT.md`, other contexts only ever receive the `UserSummary` shape (`id`, `orgId`, `teamId`, `role`, `email`) — never the raw row, never `password_hash`. Per tenet S1, this feature is where the hashing pattern gets locked in for the new codebase, not just carried forward informally.

Also completed as part of this feature (not originally listed above, but naturally unblocked once `identity_access.users` existed): `getUser(userId)`, an API `CONTRACT.md` already promised before this feature existed to implement it; and `teams.owner_id`'s foreign key to `users.id`, deferred by `002-team-hierarchy.md`'s own migration since `users` didn't exist yet. See `specs/007-user-accounts-registration/` for the full spec/plan/research/tasks.
