# Epic 010: UI Polish & Accessibility

**Priority:** 10
**Status:** not-started
**Goal:** A final consistency and accessibility pass across every page in the product, once every page already has its own real, finished design — the last thing that happens before go-live.

## Overview

**Redistributed (2026-07-23), formerly "Epic 009/010: UI Redesign".** This epic originally owned applying the Claude design mockups across every page as one big pass at the end. That approach assumed pages would ship with placeholder/unstyled UI and get their real look later. In practice, `003-audit-compliance/003-audit-log-ui.md` proved a different pattern works instead: each epic builds its own page with real, finished design directly, using its own Claude design mockup, as soon as that mockup exists — no placeholder-then-redesign step. The user decided to make that the standing pattern for the whole backlog, not a one-off.

As a result, this epic's original per-page features were distributed into the epics that actually own each page:

| Former feature here | New home |
|---|---|
| `001-design-tokens-and-theming.md` | `backlog/004-app-shell-and-landing/001-design-tokens-and-theming.md` |
| `002-auth-and-onboarding-redesign.md` | `backlog/002-identity-access/009-auth-and-onboarding-ui.md` |
| `003-workspace-redesign.md` (dashboard/teams/projects) | Dashboard/landing → `backlog/004-app-shell-and-landing/003-marketing-landing-page.md` and the shell's own composition (`002-app-shell-and-navigation.md`); teams → `backlog/002-identity-access/010-account-and-team-settings-ui.md`; projects → `backlog/006-prompt-registry/006-prompt-registry-views-ui.md` |
| `004-governance-views-redesign.md` | `backlog/005-governance/005-governance-views-ui.md` |
| `005-prompt-registry-views-redesign.md` | `backlog/006-prompt-registry/006-prompt-registry-views-ui.md` |
| `006-workflow-views-redesign.md` | `backlog/007-workflow-orchestration/005-workflow-views-ui.md` |
| `007-settings-and-admin-views-redesign.md` (api-keys/org-team/audit-log/billing) | api-keys/org-team → `backlog/002-identity-access/010-account-and-team-settings-ui.md`; audit-log → already done, `backlog/003-audit-compliance/003-audit-log-ui.md`; billing → `backlog/009-billing-entitlements/003-billing-portal-and-ui.md` |
| `008-cross-page-polish-and-accessibility.md` | Stays here, renumbered `001-cross-page-polish-and-accessibility.md` — this is the one thing that genuinely can't be distributed, since it needs every other page done first |

What's left in this epic is exactly that last row: a final cross-page pass, once everything above is actually built.

## Notes

This epic no longer gates on `backlog/000-foundations/010-design-system.md` directly — that foundations item's deliverable (`context/design-system.md`) is now produced by `backlog/004-app-shell-and-landing/001-design-tokens-and-theming.md`, much earlier in the backlog than this epic's original slot.

If a future page redesign surfaces a real UX gap (missing empty state, confusing flow, etc.) during that page's own owning-epic build, track it as a new feature in that epic, not here — this epic's scope is verification/consistency across already-built pages, not building anything new itself.
