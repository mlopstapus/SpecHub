# Specification Quality Checklist: App Shell & Navigation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The source backlog item's Open Question (nav item naming/composition disagreement between the two source mockups) was resolved during spec-writing, not deferred as a [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker — real evidence existed to settle it (`src/bcs/prompt-registry/OWNERSHIP.md` already owns both `/prompts/*` and `/projects/*` as distinct routes), so it's recorded under Assumptions with its reasoning rather than left open.
- All items pass on first validation pass; no iteration needed.
